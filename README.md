# FlowChat

The project is based on firebase. It’s a simple chat application that includes login
functionality and the possibility to join some predefined chat
rooms. When joining a room, the last 50 messages are loaded
and then new messages are added automatically as they come in.
The following task are implemented:

1. Splash screen ✔ ( only on android, since I dont have an Apple computer )
2. Login screen ✔
3. Chat rooms ✔
4. Open chat room ✔
5. Send and receive messages ✔
